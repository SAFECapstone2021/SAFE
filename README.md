this is our readme. 

Our project priority is to create an anonmymous feedback form that is has minimal point of entry and is sent to a chosen entity of the deparment (ie the deparment chair, our sponsor). This can be extended to multiple channels if we have the functionality of a single channel down. 


FIRST TIME RUNNING:

run the node package manager, npm. run 'npm install' in your terminal to install all the dependencies thus far in this project. 

note that an app has already been created for heroku, so dont create your own.
