this is our readme. 


Our project priority is to create an anonmymous feedback form that is has minimal point of entry and is sent to a chosen entity of the deparment (ie the deparment chair, our sponsor). This can be extended to multiple channels if we have the functionality of a single channel down. 


FIRST TIME RUNNING:

run the node package manager, npm. run 'npm install' in your terminal to install all the dependencies thus far in this project. 

to run locally: npm start , click on local port at top of server comments
to run on heroku cloud: heroku open

SAFE is an anonymous feedback app.
Anonymous feedback can enable senders to give honest feedback without fear of judgement.
